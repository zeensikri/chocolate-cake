Make a well at the center of the bowl. Pour egg, oil, vanilla extract and milk. Whisk together all the wet ingredients. Then mix wet and dry together until just combined and no lumps appear. Pour boiling hot water and whisk until all the water is absorbed by the batter. The batter is runny at the stage. Pour this to the cake pans. Tap the pans gently twice to the counter. Bake at 175 C for 28-30 minutes or until the tester inserted comes out clean. Please adjust the timing as it depends on the oven. Cool the cake in the pans on a wire rack for 10 mins. Invert to a cooling rack and cool completely before frosting
